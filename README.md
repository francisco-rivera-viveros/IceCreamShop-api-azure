This a small project I did to learn I specially use the stack TypeScript/C# ASP.NET CORE/Azure cause this was the stack I wanted to learn altough it is my first full stack deployed project and it's not perfect I'm really proud of the project it could be humble but it was great to share it with my friend I just show them the prototype and ask them to enter the webApp and write their favorite Ice Cream Flavour it was fun to share that
and it was alsoo super great to learn a lot of new things!!! from every technology!! 

from Typescript how useful it is when you want your code to get the specific data type!!!
from C# and ASP .NET CORE I learned it was actually not that hard to learn and I started to get used to the langue and the syntax and the way you declared the controllers and the Routes!
from Azure I learned the way and the steps to publish even deploying from vscode and run your web app and some concepts like Resource Group, App Service, Azure SQL , etc !
